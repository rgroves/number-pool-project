# ToDo

This section contains notes on things I should do later...

- [ ] Read about [SCRAM](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-scram/)
- [ ] Read more about [NodeJS Security Checklist](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-security-checklist/)
- [ ] Read about [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
- [ ] Read about [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors)

- [ ] How to properly setup and implement CORS
- [ ] During development I created a temporary user for access to my mongodb instance. Probably want to eventually create users with specific privileges for use in the live app.
